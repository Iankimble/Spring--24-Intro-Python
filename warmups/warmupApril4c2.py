# Create a function that will ask the user to enter a date to

# The user should be prompted to enter the month and date. 
# If the day they entered is incorrect, print a message 
# informing them it is incorrect and re-ask them to enter 
# the correct birthday. If the user enters the correct birth date,
#  your function should congratulate them and stop the loop.  

# Keywords / Clues:
# Variable, Function, If/Else (Conditionals),
# Loop, take in user data

# Context:
# Re-ask user if they enter the incorrect B-day
# Ask the user to enter a birthday, 
# if they enter the correct date: congratulate them and end the loop
