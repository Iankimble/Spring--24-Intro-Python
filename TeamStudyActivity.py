# Team Study Activity

# Work together in groups to solve the following problems together.
# When you are finished, submit your group work from one (1) of your teammates
# repositories. 
# Make sure that you include the name of each person in your group on your 
# python code document in order to get credit.

# be sure to write down clues and keywords as you solve the problems to get full credit.
# be sure to use your notes, W3schools, and more importantly your team!
# be sure to name your file teamStudyActivity.py

# 1. Farm animal function
# Create a function that will count and return the number of limbs for any given anmial.
# your function should take the animal name and the quantity of that animal as parameters.
# Your function should be using the following animals: cow (4 limbs), chicken (2 limbs),
# goat(2 limbs). If there is an animal or value passed into the function parameter that 
# has not been provided in the instructions, your program should return a custom error message saying
# "animal/ value not found. Please enter a correct value".

# example of what should happen: 
# animalLimbs(cow, 4) = the answer should be 16

# 2. String count; odd or even function 
# Create a function that will take in a string value, count the characters in the string
# and determine if the total number of characters are odd or even. You may pass in the string 
# value as either a parameter or by using the input function. The function should also
# print out the message "this word is even."

# 3. Team quiz game
# create a quiz game function that will ask users specific questions about your team members,
# and allows a user to enter an aswer. Each team member should have two (2) questions about them.
# Once all the questions are answered, the program should print out how many the user got
# right compared to how many they got wrong; for example if there are 10 questions and the user
# got 5 right, they should have a final score of 5/10.
