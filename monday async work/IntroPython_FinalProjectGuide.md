# Introduction to Python Final Project

## Overview 
You will use the next two weeks to design and develop a Python terminal program using all of the 
concepts you've learned throughout the semester. Your program should include more than 1 python function
to accomplish it's task and should also use a combnitation of data types, operators, and constructs. Your program should also include a python concept we haven't learned about in class (this can be somthing such as objects or built-in functions we did not discuss in class).You are permitted to work individually or in groups. 

Your project start date will be : 5/3/2024
Your project due date is : 5/17/2024

<b>The design and development of your project will have three phases: design, development, presentation</b>

## Phase 1- Design
During the design phase you will come up with an idea for your program and develop a pitch for your program. Your pitch should consist of at least 3 paragraphs explaining what your idea is, what problem your
program is trying to solve, and who your program is designed for and why. If necessary, conduct research in developing your pitch and refining your program idea.

Before you move into beginning work on your idea, your pitch must be reviewed and approved by the instrcutor. Once your idea is approved you will proceed into the wireframe phase.

Once you've developed your pitch, you will need to develop a basic wireframe showcasing what your program woul look like as an app on a mobile phone.
Your wireframes should show each step of how your app will work (ie. what happens when the click on buttons, enter text, etc.)
You will also need to create a development plan on how you will develop your app. you will need to conduct research and describe step by step what you will do to get your program to work. This plan does not need to be written in code, but rather it should be similar to the prompt breakdowns we do in class; review your pitch, and then think and write down how you would accomplish builing your program with python.

Your wireframes and development plan must be reviewed and approved by the instructor before moving on. 

## Phase 2- Development
You will start writing the code to get your program to work. Your program will need to run in the terminal.
Your finished program should not have any errors and should run efficiently. Once you've completed your app
commit and push your work to your class github repository. If you are working in a group make sure that
all of the contributors names are on the python file. This will need to be completed and submitted no 
later than 5/17/2024 by 11:59 pm.


## Phase 3- Presentation
Once youve completed and pushed your work to your github you will need to present your project.
During your presentation you will need to do the following:
- Introduce yourself- your name and grade.
- Introduce your project/ program- tell the class what your project is about, why you made it, and who your project is for.
- Demonstrate your working program- showcase to the class your working program, walkthrough how your program works step by step.
- Fielding questions - you will need to answer questions from the instructors and your peers on the 
design and development of your program.
