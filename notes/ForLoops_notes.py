# the list we want to iterate over.

for x in birdGame: 
# another way of saying/ thinking about this is:
# "for the number of 'blank' inside of this list.- do this..."
    print(x) # we ar telling or program to just print whatever is in the list.

# "x" is not quite our iterator in that it is a starting point, but rather a 
# rather a representation of somthing inside of a list.
    

# how can we use the break keyword to stop the for loop?
# how can we use the range funtion to loop through a set of numbers- provide an example
# of a game of chess where they have 1 hour to win in 40 moves
    
# examples of loops,
# looping through a list of data to find a reciept
# looping through a list of words to find specific letters

# create a for loop that will pull and count the number of times a specific word appears
# in this story.
