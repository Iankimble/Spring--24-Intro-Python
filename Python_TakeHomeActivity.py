# Intro to Python
# Take home activity

# Instructions
# Create a new Python file called pythonWeekendActivity.py and answer the following questions. 
# This activity contains six (6) questions. This assignment must be completed by no later than 
# 11:59 pm on Sunday March 10th,
# 2024 to receive full credit. 
 
# Two (2) coding prompt questions. 
# You need to solve each coding prompt. To get full credit, 
# you must write down the clues and keywords you find.
# The clues and keywords should be words and phrases 
# we’ve heard in class, but they can also be things YOU 
# believe will help you solve the problem.
  
# Two (2) code deciphering questions. 
# You need to read and describe each code block 
# and explain what is happening on each line. 
# You must use complete sentences to get full credit. 

# Two(2) Open-ended Programming Questions.
# To get full credit, you must write a short
#  paragraph (3-4 sentences) responding to these
# questions. You must use complete sentences.  

# Coding Prompts
# You have been hired as an engineer to develop 
# a VIP list function. The client would like your 
# program to check the names of the people on their 
# list and confirm whether they can get into the VIP 
# section. If the person’s name is on the list, 
# they should be greeted with a message saying 
# they may enter the VIP section. If they are not 
# on the list, they must return to the general
# admission section. Your program should
# check users' names by accepting the guest's 
# name as an argument. 
# The client has provided a list of VIP
# guests that they would like to check and admit
# into the VIP room.

VIP_Guests=["Bill", "Mary", "Dante", "Stacy", "Harry", "Ashley"] 

# You have been hired as an engineer to develop 
# a discount rewards program for a store. 
# The store would like your function to ask
# users to enter their name, their membership tier, 
# the item they are buying, and the item's price. 
# Depending on the customer’s membership tier, 
# they will receive one of the following discounts: 
# 25% off for the Gold tier, 15% off for the silver tier,
# and 5% off for the bronze tier. Your program 
# should calculate and return a message to the user
# by name, congratulating them and providing them 
# with the new item price (example: Congratulations, 
# Dan! Your item is now $10.00. Thank you for shopping
# with us. )

# Code Deciphering 
# Breakdown and describe what happens in each line 
# of the following code blocks. Then, based on the 
# context of this problem, give each function an 
# appropriate name. 

def unknownFunction_A(data1, data2):
    newData = data2 + 10
    print(f"hello, {data1}. Welcome to Boys Latin.")
    print("by solving this, you have gotten"+ data2 "points added to your grade")

def unknownFunction_B(data1, data2):
    if data1 == "btp@gmail.com" and data2 == "abc123":
	    print("Welcome, access granted.")
    elif data1 != "btp@gmail.com" or data2 != "abc123":
 	    print("Sorry, your information is incorrect")
    else:
        print(" Error: somthing went wrong. Try again")
