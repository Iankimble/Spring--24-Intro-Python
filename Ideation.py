# Brainstorm
# Focus App 
# - Q: how can I help people focus on their activities?
# - Goals: I want to help people accomplish more, 
# to improve their mental health, as well as their attention span. 

# app shuts down their phone - but only keeps the bare necessities (phone calls, text)
# user can select which key phone functions that will still be usable
# these options are blocked only for 15 minutes. 
# cold turkey feature - the phone can only take and make calls, everything else is
# blocked for an interval set by the user. 
# only shuts down youtube, instagram, tik-tok, facebook, and games
# everyday at certain points in the day, the app will go in focus,
# if they can be focused for 15minutes, they get points / currency

# wireframe

# I need a function that checks the time of day - function to get time
# depending on the time it will, go into focus mode. - loop over time
# when in focus mode, certain functions cannot be used. - set time intervals

# K-box app - play games on the go
# program should show games available to play
# users can select between 3 games 
# tik-tak-toe mini game
# guessing mini game
# mystery mini game
