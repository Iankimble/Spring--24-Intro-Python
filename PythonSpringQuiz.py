# 4. Research the range() function. Then create a function that takes 2 arguements. 
# Your function should take the range of the first argument and multiply those numbers by the second 
# argument. 

# 5. Create a function that will ask the user guess the correct number.
# Your function should take a user input which will be their guess. Your function should 
# generate a random number between 1 and 5. If the user guesses the number correctly, the program
# will inform the user they guessed correctly and end the game. If the user guesses incorrectly, they
# will be informed their guess is incorrect and to guess again. The user should only be able to guess
# incorrectly 3 times. If they get the 3rd attempt wrong, the program should inform they user they have lost
# the game.

# 6. Create a function that will act as a saving calculator. Your function should take several inputs from
# the user. Your program should ask the user what they are saving up for, how much does it cost, and how much 
# they want to deposit this week. Your program should repeat asking the user how much would they like to
# save this week, until the goal amount has been satisfied. Each time the user makes a deposit, your
# program should inform them how many weeks they have left, how much money they have deposited, and how
# much money their is remaining to reach their goal. 

# Ex. if my goal is to save $500, and deposit $20 dollars for that week, it should tell me that 
# It will take me 25 weeks to reach my goal based on the 20 dollar deposit, I have $20 saved,
# and that I need $480 more dollars.

# If I deposit $40 dollars the next week it should tell me
# it will take 10 weeks to reach my goal based on the $40 dollar deposit, I have $60 saved, and that I need 
# $440 more dollars to reach my goal.
